# Simple Java Calculator

Welcome to our fork of Simple Java Calculator!

## Our Purpose

* Learn about Open-Source Software through active participation.
* Improve OOP skills by focusing on a simple Java app.
* _It’s a team effort._ We adopted many techniques commonly used by OSS projects, including the GitFlow branching model, GitHub pull requests, code review, and more. This is our chance to see what works (and what doesn't) and learn how to work effectively as a team.

## From the Original Author

This project was originally written using Eclipse, but I have migrated it to NetBeans.
This calculator is simple with an easy code to help novices learn how to create a calculator program with Java.

If you use the executable "SimpleJavaCalculator.jar" file and that doesn't work, you can type `java -jar /your_calculator_directory/SimpleJavaCalculator.jar` in your terminal.
